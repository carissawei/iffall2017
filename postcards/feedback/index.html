<h2>Feedback: Katie Heider</h2>
<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
<li>High contrast between images and background color</li>
<li>Consistent aethetic across all compositions</li>
<li>The brightness of the colors and images makes the words difficult to read</li>
<li>The white words could become more legible against darker background colors</li>
<li>The type feels secondary comparared to the dynamic images</li>
<li>The characters are pretty large to the top and bottom of the screen</li>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<li>Design focuses on the central characters</li>
<li>Design is relatively simple and easy to understand</li>
<li>The type stands out more in the wider compositions but feels like a background element on the mobile screen</li>
<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<li>Composition is consistent for both sizes</li>
<li>What happens to the text as it moves from the side to the top?</li>
<li>Images are well considered and managed</li>
